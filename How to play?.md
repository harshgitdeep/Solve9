## Do you know what is sudoku?
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves placing numbers from 1 to 9 into a 9x9 grid. The grid is divided into 3x3 sub-grids called "regions", and the objective is to fill the grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, known as "givens" or "clues".

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** Fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 such that every row, every column, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contains all the digits from 1 to 9.

2. **Rules:**
   - Each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
   - Each column must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
   - Each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Start with a partially filled 9x9 grid.
   - Use logic and reasoning to deduce the correct numbers to fill in the remaining cells.
   - Numbers cannot be changed once placed, so careful planning and strategy are essential.
   - The game is solved when all cells are filled correctly according to the rules.

## Tips

- **Start with the corners and centers:** Focusing on corners and centers can help establish the framework for filling in other numbers.
  
- **Use the process of elimination:** Deduce which numbers can or cannot go in each cell by examining the other numbers in the row, column, and region.

- **Practice regularly:** Sudoku improves with practice. The more you play, the better you'll get at recognizing patterns and strategies.
